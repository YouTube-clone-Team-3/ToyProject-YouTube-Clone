            "description": "Despite its name, Earth may be the only planet in our solar system that has oceans. It is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system and perhaps the only one that harbors life.\n\nThe Earth's seas and oceans, which cover 70% of its surface, are home to a large amount of life. With an average depth of 4 km, they account for 97% of the water on the planet. In addition, they feature some impressive landforms: the most extensive mountain range, the Mid-Oceanic Ridge, is deep under the sea. Four times as long as the Andes, the Rocky Mountains, and the Himalayas arranged in a row, it stretches 65,000 km across the Arctic and the Atlantic.\n\nA study carried out jointly by the Universities of Münster, Cambridge, and the Zurich Technique showed that the age of the planet is between 4,400 million and 4,510 million years. So far, five mass extinctions have been recorded on the planet. The first occurred 440 million years ago and the last 65 million years ago. Michael Rampino, an Earth science expert at New York University, argues that it takes about 30 million years for the Solar System to cross the plane of the Milky Way. The presence of the system could be one of the reasons why comets' orbits are destabilized, launching them towards the planet. To this, he adds a possibility that is little studied today: dark matter.\n\n8.7 million species, a single planet. The ecosystems that we depend on, as humans, to survive are made up of around 8.7 million plant and animal species. At least this is confirmed by a study by the University of Hawaii (United States) carried out in 2011, which is said to be the most accurate to date. Of these, we only know 1.3 million. Unfortunately, WWF warns with its Living Planet report that, since the 70s of the last century, only the world population of vertebrates has been reduced by 60% due to global warming, the destruction of ecosystems, and the crisis of biodiversity caused by human action. It is in our power to care for and protect (and even discover) all those species that make our planet an (almost) inexhaustible source of life.\n\nFollow me:\n►YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8D_NXFBh8A9KSwo7x-wFdQ/\n\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/bruno.saraviavega\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brunosaravia\n\nCanon - Sony - Nikon - Adobe Premiere Pro CC - Photoshop - Lightroom CC\nYoutube Business - Youtube Profit - Bank Credit - Loans - Educational - Education - Insurance\n\nEARTH in 8K ULTRA HD - Tour Through the Planet Earth - Best Places and Animals Relaxing Music 8K TV (FUHD) Demo 8K ULTRA HD\n\n#8K #PLANET #EARTH",

            "description": "THE COLORS OF THE OCEAN is a beautiful and RELAXING 8K Film about Sea Life and Marine Animals. In this video, we can watch marine animals from all over the world, with beautiful colors and shapes for relaxing sleep, or relaxation time.\nIt is estimated that 70 and 80 percent of all life on earth is below the ocean's surface and the oceans contain 99 percent of the planet's living space. Less than 11% of that space has been explored by humans. About 85 percent of the area and 90 percent of the volume constitute the dark and cold environment that we call the deep sea. The average depth of the ocean is 3,761 meters. The average height of the terrain is 850 meters.\nSo there are at least 236,878 marine species, but most likely there are at least 750,000 marine species, and possibly up to 25 million marine species. That's amazing!\nThe lowest known point on our Earth, called Challenger Deep, is 11,034 meters deep, in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific. To get an idea of ​​how deep that is, if I could take Mount Everest and place it at the bottom of that place, there would still be more than a mile of the ocean above. The Dead Sea is the lowest land point on Earth with an elevation of 396 meters below sea level.\n\nSome Facts about the ocean and Sea Life:\n\n- Ocean water looks blue and not transparent. Sunlight is made up of all colors. When it reaches the sea, this white light passes through the water, absorbing the red and orange tones and allowing the green and bluish tones to pass through.\n- The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean in the world. It occupies a third of its surface and extends approximately 15,000 km from the Bering Sea bordering the Arctic in the north to the south with Antarctica.\n- The oceanic clam, a marine mollusk from the North Atlantic, is the oldest animal in history with an estimated age of 507 years. It is about 8 cm long.\n- The largest mountainous area in the world is under the sea and is known as the mid-ocean ridges that run through the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian and Pacific.\n\nfollow me:\n►YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8D_NXFBh8A9KSwo7x-wFdQ/\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/bruno.saraviavega\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brunosaraviaphotography\n\nCanon - Sony - Nikon - Adobe Premiere Pro CC - Photoshop - Lightroom CC\nYoutube Business - Youtube Profit - Bank Credit - Loans - Educational - Education - Insurance\n\nThe Colors of the Ocean 8K ULTRA HD - The Best 8K Sea Animals for Relaxation & Calming Music (FUHD) Demo 8K ULTRA HD\n\n#8K #ANIMALS #AQUARIUM",

              "description": "Welcome to Earth Relaxation !\nCanada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. A highly developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks.\nMusic has so many benefits, and one of them is that it calms your nerves down. It's always a good idea to listen to some background music while you're doing something.
